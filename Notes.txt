Figure out sensible way of setting up session secret
Whack (de)serializeUser into their own functions: // passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser()); // passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());
Set up isInGame with game ID & state in Mongo
Save passport-twitch changes so they can be fetched by NPM
Make nav work with Bootstrap 5
Create audit on users {audit: created: DATE, updated: { profileImage: DATE, displayName: DATE }, banned: [DATE, DATE], unbanned: [DATE, DATE]}
Show error messages on logins
Link userid/sessioninfo
Kill session upon ban and log out using socket.io redirect to logout page
Move flashes into its own EJS template
Make flashes dismissable
Add unit tests!
Make sure try/catch is *everywhere*
Use a foreach on flashes to show multiple messages
Ensure member ID in Teams table references Users table with objectID (currently using Twitch ID instead of objectID)
Wrap fetchTwitchChatColour() in try/catch
Sanitise chat messages using innerText for chat message, and innerhtml for the username prefix
